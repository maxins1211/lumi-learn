# LumiLearn

A Secure Java MVC E-Learning Platform

LumiLearn is a role-based e-learning web application built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Thymeleaf**. It was originally developed as part of **Assignments 2 and 3** in the _Enterprise Java Development_ course at Sheridan College. After completing the course, I enhanced the project, added new features, and deployed it to **Heroku**.

## Features

- Role-based authentication and authorization using Spring Security
- Admin dashboard for course and user management
- Student dashboard for course enrollment and viewing
- Server-side rendering with Thymeleaf
- Data Access Object layer implemented with JDBC and H2 in-memory database
- Codebase streamlined using Lombok
